## About Paperless-AI next

Paperless-AI next is a fork of the original [Paperless-AI](https://github.com/clusterzx/paperless-ai) project, created to build on its foundation with many new features and ongoing maintenance. The goal is to continue development in an open and community-driven way, with regular updates, cool features, and a strong focus on user feedback. 

It connects to your [Paperless-ngx](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx) instance and uses an AI of your choice to automatically read, understand, and classify your documents.

Every time a new document lands in Paperless-ngx, Paperless-AI next picks it up, figures out what it is, and assigns the right tags, title, document type, and correspondent – so you don't have to. And if OCR quality is poor, it can even send the document through a dedicated Mistral OCR queue before tagging.

:::caution[Important]
It is highly recommended to use an reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx, Caddy) in front of Paperless-AI next for security and performance, especially if you expose it to the internet - which is not a recommended practice at this time.
